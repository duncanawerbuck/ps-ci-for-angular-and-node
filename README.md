As per Alexander Zanfir's Pluralsight course: (Continuous Integration and Deployment for AngularJS and Node.js)[http://pluralsight.com/courses/continuous-integration-deployment-angularjs-nodejs]

This README is updated with what's done so far as I implement an example project that's *almost* identical to Alexander's course.
